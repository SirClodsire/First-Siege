This is a blog about a game we made at Daydream Vancouver!
It's called Twin Chaser, a two player game where one person attempts to catch the other!
All the information can be found on the blog!
This is an HTML website with a bit of css. I hope you enjoy it!
P.S: Some links might not work, Idk why as of right now.
You don't need to install anything, or that I'm aware of.
