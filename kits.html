    <h1>OMG is this a Bedwars referance?</h1>
    <p>This is a section dedicated to Kits!</p>
    <h4>NOTE: Kits have NOT been added to the game yet. This is merely a concept!</h4>
    <br>
    <h4>So, what is a Kit?</h4>
    <p>A Kit is basically an upgrade for your character. However, that upgrade is bound to the Kit, so if you switch Kits, you switch upgrades!</p>
    <p>For example, If I am using the Nihil kit, then I get access to all of Nihil's powers. However, once I switch to the Warper kit, all my Nihil powers</p>
    <p>are gone, and I gain Warper's powers instead!</p>
    <br>
