    <h1>FAQ</h1>

    <p>What inspired you to make twin chaser?</p>
    <p>Recently, my brother has started to beef with me. He would get angry for no reason and chase me around a lot, so the theme of it would be us chasing each other!</p>
    <p>The style of the game was suggested by a member of our group at Daydream. He remembered playing a Tom and Jerry game when he was young and Tom had to catch Jerry just like how My brother is trying to catch me! </p>
    <br>
    <p>What part did you contribute in Twin Chaser?</p>
    <p>I was the one who did all the art for the Twins, while my friend Paya did all the coding! Another friend did the design for the platforms and the floors, but I was the one to place them down.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Was it a sucessfull game?</p>
    <p>Personally, I felt like it was very sucessfull. Even though it didn't win any awards, our group was at the corner of the presentation area, and not much people visited it. Still, quite a few people did vote for it and I feel like</p>
    <p>If we had better positioning me might have actually won 4th!</p>
    <br>
    <p>What were your thought process behind the colour schemes used for both players?</p>
    <p>For the runner (who is based off me), I used to wear a blue sweater all the time, and my brother would wear a red sweater of the same brand with the same model. </p>
    <p>At the event, My friend suggested me using the same colour scheme as they are stark opposites and would display rivalry. Also, red tends to represent agressiveness, and that's what the chaser symbolyses!</p>
