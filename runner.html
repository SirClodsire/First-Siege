    <h4>Camping Spots:</h4>
    <img src="Camping Spots-Twin Chaser.png" alt="Camping Spots">
    <p>1. The classic camp spot.</p>
    <p>This is your classical camping spot. It should be where you camp 90% of the time, and when the round starts, your usual priority is to get here as fast as possible.</p>
    <p>I highly reccomend going to the far right side of the map, instead of jumping on the platform closer to it. it's slightly faster,</p>
    <p>but is very risky to pull off. Only for the experienced!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Once you're there, make sure to stay there until the chaser gets on the green platform or the blue platform. Do note that inexperienced players tend to fail the jump</p>
    <p>from the blue platform, and the green platform does provide a bit of "endlag" as when they jump onto it, they will jump higher than intened</p>
    <p>and fall onto the grey platform underneith, providing a bit of time.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. The alternative camp spot.</p>
    <p>This is the spot where you go to bait the chaser from the green platform onto the grey platform beside the usual camp spot.</p>
    <p>then you jump back to the main camp spot, which will make the chaser attemp to do it as well, but 80% of the time they will fall down onto the brown platform instead.</p>
    <p>This is because they usually make rash decisions, and when you jump back onto the platform, they just press the "d" butt on and not the "w". However, if they</p>
    <p>do make it onto the platform, this is still a good way to initiate a chase.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. The situational camp spot.</p>
    <p>This is the spot where you camp only if they are somewhere on the left side of the map, and should only be used to gain distance. The chaser will usually take the right side path,</p>
    <p>making this the reason this camp spot is "situational". Otherwise, it should only be used as a stepping stone for the main camp spot, as it outclasses this one in almost all possible ways.</p>
    <br>
    <p>4. The Jump immidiately camp spot.</p>
    <p>This camp spot should only be used if the chaser is somehow way on the other side of the map. Under NO other circumstances should it be used otherwise, as it will</p>
    <p>(most likely) lead to certain death!</p>
    <br>
    <h4>That's all for the camp spots! While playtesting, I might find more, so don't expect this to be final!</h4>
    <br>
    <h4>Juking!</h4>
    <img src="Jucking-Twin Chaser.png" alt="Juking Spots">
    <p>1. The jump up, drop down</p>
    <p>This tech is something called looping. it basically is when you just repete the same actions around a "loop" and the chaser will never be able to catch you!</p>
    <p>However, while dropping down, make sure you have a good amount of space in between you and the chaser, otherwise the "endlag" will get you and the chaser will win!</p>
    <p>Another location where this is viable is the centre green platform and the 1x2 wooden platforms. Just loop around with a bit of space between you and the chaser and you'll be fine!</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. The down and down</p>
    <p>This tech should be used to trick the Chaser. When you drop down onto the first platform, they expect you to jump onto the centre green platform. But instead of doing that,</p>
    <p>you jump onto the lower left platform instead! This will trick the Chaser, who expects you to jump onto the green platform. When they get used to this tech, actually jump onto the green!</p>
    <p>Swapping like this can trick them even more!</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. The high Loop</p>
    <p>This is very similar to the other loops, exept it's a once use and more of a getaway tool. As mentioned above, attempting that jump has severe endlag no matter how you approach it.</p>
    <p>This is why it's more of an escape tool than a looping place, as if you use it more than once, they will catch up and that will end up being your demise!</p>
    <br>
    <h4>That's all the juking/looping spots! As similar to above, expect more discoveries!</h4>

    <h4>The runner is the harder one to play. Usually, the chaser wins due to the unfair hitbox and having a set goal in mind, and a lot of it does come down to luck.</h4>
    <h4>However, if you practice and memorised the map, you should be set up for victory!</h4>
    <h4>That's all for the runner! </h4>
